# Alec's Coreutils

## What is this?
This is a repo where I experiment with redesigning and renaming the core POSIX tools.

## Why?
Why not? These are tools that we live with every day and we might as well try to see if there are better ways of doing it.

## Inspiration
Unix Haters Handbook

## Design
See design.md
